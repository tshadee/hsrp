    <h1>what is hsrp?</h1>
    <p>/wɒt ɪz ˌeɪtʃ ɛs ɑː ɹ piː/</p>
    <p>hsrp is an abbreviation of Hydrophase'S RePository (HSRP)</p>
    <p>this website was created to store and document various projects, skills, and experiences of <i class="hidden-link transition-default">hydrophase</i> in a form that</p>
    <p>he believes might be more interesting than the typical portfolio. the navigation of this website uses <i class="hidden-link transition-default">hidden links</i> that takes</p>
    <p>the user to the page containing that specific word - kind of like <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/" class="hidden-link-red transition-default">Wikipedia</a> , but with a hint of mystery!</p>
    <span class="par-space"> - </span>
    <p>hsrp is coded entirely from scratch using html, css, and javascript and is hydrophase's first experience with these languages!
    <p>please forgive both minor and major inconveniences should you encounter them...</p>
