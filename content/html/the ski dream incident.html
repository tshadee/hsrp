    <h1>The Ski Dream Incident <span class="at-location">@ dreamland 07.12.2025</span></h1>

    <p>Right, so this is more of a diary entry than a page on <a class="hidden-link transition-default" data-dialog="hydrophase">hydrophase's</a> website. Not like anyone's going to find this! Hopefully...</p>
    <span class="par-space"> - </span>
    <p>The story begins with hydrophase falling asleep, as does many other stories. He slept peacefully for most of the night - a Saturday night that waned into Sunday. He had a perfunctory sleep. Not good, not terrible. To call it average was stretching it, but it was not 'bad' by any means... well, it isn't like he remembers much before <a class="hidden-link transition-default">the ski dream incident</a>.</p>
    <span class="par-space"> - </span>
    <p>Onto the main topic. The dream begins after hydrophase decided to continue sleeping after his alarm went off at 6:00am. On a Sunday. Now, combine the fact that hydrophase remembers this very well, and that it was likely a light sleep, one can infer that this is a lucid dream. Hydrophase had once been able to recognise lucid dreams, but had long since abandoned such a strenuous mental task (you first have to condition yourself before sleeping then be on 'high-alert' throughout the day just to build the habit of cross-examining everything in reality in order to realise that un-reality of a lucid dream).</p>
    <span class="par-space"> - </span>
    <p>He was on a skiiing slope. Or a newly-snowed, fluffy slope. He is not sure what to make of it because the impression was that it was at an angle of roughly 70 degrees, i.e. nearly vertical. There was one person in front, a woman, and a person behind, likely a man, he felt like it was a close friend but cannot tell who. The 'skiing' slope was as wide as a truck which, relative to normal skii courses, is dangerously narrow. It was narrow enough that hydrphase, digging his fingers into the snow in fear of falling down, could shuffle side-to-side to avoid the falling giant snowball.</p>
    <span class="par-space"> - </span>
    <p>This giant snowball, now that he thought about it, took great inspiration from that one iron ball in Elden Ring's Raya Lucaria on the staircase before Moongrum's garden and his resting place - the elevator to Queen Rennala's library. Anyways! The giant snowball barrelled down the slope, bouncing from side to side (he is not sure how as the track's edges is just unflatenned new snow).</p>
    <span class="par-space"> - </span>
    <p>Seeking to avoid this snowball, hydrophase watched intently as it neared and with a mighty pull, flung himself to the side! The woman no longer existed in the dream now, but hydrophase felt himself fly for a moment and then get hit by the snowball. He did not, in fact, dodge it.</p>
    <span class="par-space"> - </span>
    <p>Then, everything went black for a moment. Hydrophase wakes up to the 'feel' of ice surrounding his body. His face was flat on the ground, twisted to the left. The camera (yes, this happens often) smoothly interpolates from first-person to third-person and he is there, in a bloody pool, on the ground, with a part of his skull cracked open. Nearby, the man was a bloody pulp. The camera then snapped back to first person as hydrophase 'passed out' from what should've been pain? Or shock? Who knows. Even he finds it hard to understand what happened.</p>
    <span class="par-space"> - </span>
    <p>Next thing he knew, hydrophase was on a bed. Not the hospital, no no, a log cabin! A little groggy, he sits up and remembers that he'd just been involved in a big accident! So he rushes out of bed, disregarding the odd 'feeling' of his head, and opens the brown wooden door with the same design as his actual bedroom door in his parent's house.</p>
    <span class="par-space"> - </span>
    <p>Outside, he rushes towards the place where he presumed he 'landed' after the accident and dug through the snow to find his phone (still working) and his car keys. A wave of relief engulfs his presence and he slowly walks back the way he came, but somewhere along the way, the scenery changed and he was now walking towards the cold piers of Petropavlovsk! Yes! Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy! The one place he searched on Google Map back in Year 12!</p>
    <span class="par-space"> - </span>
    <p>As he approached the man, hydrophase noticed that familiar feeling. He cannot tell you who, but 'uncle', 'friend', 'father', 'brother', all fit the description here - a familiar male counterpart. He waved at the man, but the man did not recognise him, so hydrophase pointed at his left parietal bone(?) which was missing (it would be more accurate to say that the 'left-upper-quadrant' (occipital bone upwards) of his head is just missing) to which the man let out a yelp of surprise!</p>
    <span class="par-space"> - </span>
    <p><i>He must be surprised to see me!</i> Thought hydrophase. Where this 'surprise' originates from is debatable - was it because of the man missing half his skull? Or seeing this man which, hydrophase presumed, had been in a coma for multiple months? Well, it is irrelevant in this context as the scene abruptly switches to a dinner back in the log cabin with hydrophase's extended family and friends from all chapters of life.</p>
    <span class="par-space"> - </span>
    <p>It was a hearty feast. A bit of drinking, a lot of laughter and speak of the sheer incredulity of hydrophase surviving the ordeal. Apparently, everyone thought that he was better off dead! That they should just disconnect whatever life preservation (not that there was any) he had and be done with it! How offensive. Once this point was brought up, hydrophase asked the man next to him - presumably his father - that he'd only been gone for around "1 or 2 years, right? I'm only 22/23. How can you lose hope that quickly?" In his mind, hydrophase was already thinking about how to catch up to his peers, how to get back to work, integrate back into society, etc. He would be a little late to the party, but at least he'd arrive on time with the other late comers! (those who did a 4-year degree or a Master's!)</p>
    <span class="par-space"> - </span>
    <p>Oh how naive. The boisterous gathering was silenced by pitiful stares directed at one person - hydrophase. His father, now suddenly full of wrinkles and scalp of white hair, said solemnly, "You are 27. You've been gone for 6 years."</p>
    <span class="par-space"> - </span>
    <p>That was when hydrophase woke up in cold sweat. 27? 6 years? The sickening feeling of loss, even if he knew it was just a dream, reminded him of some unfortunate times. 6 years is an immense amount of time - enough for one to change completely. To be divest of 6 years of life - a youthful life, no better - that hydrophase had so looked forward to? Then what was the point of it all? Should he just...</p>
    <span class="par-space"> - </span> 
    <p>And so he reminded himself that it was a dream. Who said he wanted a horror show? How offensive! He had to do his laundry before tomorrow arrived!</p>
