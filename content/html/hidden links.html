    <h1>hidden links</h1>
    <p>/ˈhɪdᵊn lɪŋks/</p>
    <p>as you may have realised, some (or most) pages will contain a <a class="hidden-link transition-default">hidden link</a>. by hovering over these, you can see what</p>
    <p>nasty things were hidden from plain sight ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) and by clicking, it takes you to the page with that word as the title.</p>
    <p>you could also use the <a class="hidden-link transition-default">search bar</a> (above) to look for pages. note that hidden links will only appear once per page</p>
    <p>and that there are four types of hidden links...</p>
