    <h1>Control and Instrumentation Engineer Internship</h1>
    <p>GULF JP UT Limited, Ayutthaya, Thailand, July 2024 &mdash; September 2024</p>

    <p>"GULF JP UT" is a branch of GULF Thailand, jointly developed and owned by an <i>obvious</i> Japanese company for the appr. $400,000,000 "U-Thai" power plant.</p>
    <p>The plant is a 1,600 MW CCGT (Combined-Cycle-Gas-Turbine) mostly LNG/methane IPP responsible for roughly 3-5% of Thailand's power capacity.</p>
    <p>As of writing (05.12.2025), it is the 5th biggest power plant in Thailand, tied alongside GULF JP NS (Nong Saeng).</p>

    <p><a class="hidden-link transition-default">Hydrophase</a> interned there for 2 months, working mostly to debug and repair faulty control boards of various instruments throughout the power plant.</p>
    <p>Being a CCGT, this meant many valve control boards. In fact, it was probably <i>all valves</i>... but electronics stems from the same fundamentals. Insight gained from this experience was used to develop the <a class="hidden-link transition-default">MYOLIGHT</a> 
        and then furthered to design far more complex boards. This, in addition to the <a class="hidden-link transition-default">Advanced PCB Design Training</a>, has broadened Hydrophase's horizons as he has interacted with both users 
        and designers of industrial, high-performance PCBs.</p>
    <p>Many thanks to the senior operators and the three other interns for their in-depth knowledge of various engineering principles.</p>

    <p>It must be said, however, that Mitsubishi DIASYS is <i>egregiously outdated</i>. By comparison, Siemens' software (SIMATIC) is actually desireable, although as one may come to find later... Hydrophase also despises their PADS PCB design software...</p>
