    <h1>Advanced PCB Design Training</h1>
    <p>EEI & Henisware, Bangkok, Thailand, October 2025 &mdash; November 2025</p>

    <p>Oct 2025 marked the start of the First Generation <a href="https://www.thaieei.com/en/" class="hidden-link-hyper transition-default">Electrical and Electronics Institute of Thailand (EEI)</a> sponsored Advanced PCB Design Training for the Siemens electronics ecosystem covering:
        <b><a href="https://eda.sw.siemens.com/en-US/pcb/pads/" class="hidden-link-hyper transition-default">Siemens PADS PCB Design Suite</a></b>, <b><a href="https://eda.sw.siemens.com/en-US/pcb/hyperlynx/" class="hidden-link-hyper transition-default">HyperLynx</a></b>, 
        and <b><a href="https://eda.sw.siemens.com/en-US/pcb/valor/valor-npi/" class="hidden-link-hyper transition-default">Valor NPI</a></b>.
    </p>

    <p>Overall, <a class="hidden-link transition-default" data-dialog="hydrophase">hydrophase's</a> impression of PADS was that it was <b>absolutely</b> terrible. <a href="https://www.altium.com/" class="hidden-link-hyper transition-default">Altium</a> and 
        <a href="https://www.kicad.org/" class="hidden-link-hyper transition-default">KiCAD</a> are far more well-integrated (KiCAD with add-ons) and user friendly
    compared to PADS which rocks a 15-year-old UI/UX design. Net class assignment, DRC setup, DDR setup, even the simple differential routing setup was a major pain point for PADS. The nightmare of it all stems from the seemingly separate development
    of their constraints manager and their stackups (planes, vias, layer assignments, etc.) which inadvertently affects controlled impedance traces. Apparently they're updating the software next year (2026) to a more modern UI feel, but the fundamentally 
    flawed integration remains to be tested... good luck, the old guy at <a href="https://fabrinet.com/" class="hidden-link-hyper transition-default">Fabrinet</a> doing DDR4...</p>

    <p>HyperLynx and Valor NPI on the other hand... wow! These are actually really nice! They're so nice that Altium and KiCAD have export options for HyperLynx that are less convoluted than PADS to HyperLynx!</p>

    <p>That aside, Power Integrity and PDNs (Power Distribution Networks) are things that <a class="hidden-link transition-default" data-dialog="UoM">The University of Manchester</a> never taught nor mentioned. Signal integrity is one part of it, but when either power
    or speed exceeds a certain limit, PI is just as important as SI. HyperLynx covers both! </p>

    <p>ODT (On-Die Termination) honestly should be more common (or accessible) for microcontrollers and FPGAs. A 50 Ohm resistor here and there is good, but 
    for dense boards, hydrophase would certainly appreciate more ODT options. Valor NPI is just your run-of-the-mill DFM. <a href="https://jlcdfm.com/" class="hidden-link-hyper transition-default">JLCDFM</a> is somehow more comprehensive.
    At any rate, this was a valuable experience which allowed hydrophase access to industry standard software for 1 year for free!</p>
