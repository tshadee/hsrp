    <h1>beat saber</h1>
    <p>/biːt ˈseɪbə/</p>
    <p>one of the VR games of all time, and one of <a class="hidden-link transition-default">hydrophase</a> 's favourites</p>
    <p>this game is usually played with two sabers (imagine star wars light sabers) used to cut blocks</p>
    <p>coming at the player. it is akin to fruit ninja but 3D and rhythm! sabers are <a class="hidden-link-red transition-default">red</a> and <a class="hidden-link transition-default">blue</a></p>
    <p>he dumped over 1500 hours in to this game and only got up to rank 247 (global)...</p>
    <p>1000 of those hours were on an account that got compromised back in 2021...</p>
