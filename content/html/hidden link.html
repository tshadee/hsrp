<div class="main__content">
    <h1>hidden link</h1>
    <p>/ˈhɪdᵊn lɪŋk/</p>
    <p>of course, someone noticed. <i class="hidden-link transition-default">hydrophase</i> did say that <i class="hidden-link transition-default">hidden links</i> are not case-sensitive</p>
    <p>but he did not say that they had fuzzy search.</p>
    <p>so, you're here. where would you like to go?</p>
    <p>or would you like... <i class="hidden-link-red transition-default" data-dialog="special permissions">special permissions</i> ?</p>
</div>
