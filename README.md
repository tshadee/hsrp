# go to hsrp.cc and click on 'about'

hsrp runs on a javascript-based content loading and procedural animation framework (see `content-loader.js`) which supports dynamic loading of html/css file pairs with specific formatting requirements

There will be some documentation, but since this is a portfolio website, I really don't think anyone will use the framework developed here since it is very 'raw' compared to other websites
